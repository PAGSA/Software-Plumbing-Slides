    "# Working with data and numpy\n",
    "By: Doug Rennehan (TA)\n",

    "In the **/data/** folder there is a file called **formation_times.txt**.  This single column of data gives the formation times (in billions of years, or $\\mathrm{Gyr}$) of stars in a simulation of an isolated galaxy. Let's investigate the distribution of formation times, and determine the star formation rate of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we assume that each \"star\" is $M_* = 2\\times10^5 \\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, where $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ is the mass of the Sun ($\\mathrm{M}_\\odot \\approx 2\\times10^{33}$ g).\n",

    "#### Answer:\n",
    "At first glance, from the above values (considering the simulation stops at $t = 2.5 \\, \\mathrm{Gyr}$) it seems that the star formation rate is relatively constant over the course of the simulation.  We infer this from the mean location at about half-way between the start and end times.  It does seem to be a bit biased toward the beginning of the simulation."
